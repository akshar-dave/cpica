//This is a college project.

### *!!* Had some issues with github backup which resulted into losing the code. I've added the apk that's done until the NOTIFICATIONS part. Download link is added below. I might restart the app from scratch later. *!!*

CPICA (Chimanbhai Patel Institute of Computer Applications)

This app is for college managerial tasks intending to help increase efficiency of the same.

App will benefit the institution in for major ways:
* __Notifications__
* __Assignments__
* __Attendance__
* __Results__

• Attendance: Students will be able to check the monthly average of their class attendance. Staff(Teachers) will be able to mark attendance easily that will directly get stored into the database.

• Assignments: Students can share their class assignments with other fellow classmates through this feature. The shared assignment file will be stored on the server and other students can leave a comment on previously shared content like, "Missing answers to question number 8".

• Announcements: Staff(Teachers, Management) can send notifications directly to students which will notify them for any upcoming events or exams or similar stuff. This would make sure that everyone stays informed.

• Results: Yearly exam results will be made available to students for analysis.
